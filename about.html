        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p id="about-me">
          Hello there, my name is Laqwanda Nettles. I’m glad you want to know
          more about me. In all honesty, I’m just a very random person, and this
          website will definitely display that. I attended Nicholls State
          University for Culinary Arts. My first love is food! Yes, I'm a
          foodie, so look forward to seeing many recipes. I started baking at
          the age of 7 with my little Easy Bake Oven with my dad; it was our
          favorite activity to do. At age 10, I began cooking on my own and
          coming up with random recipes. One of my greatest hobbies, however, is
          learning and discovering new things. My new path has led me to
          software development. I am currently enrolled in a CodeX Academy boot
          camp. So, I hope you enjoy my random thoughts of : education, food,
          inspiration, and laughter.

        Due to some health reasons, I was no longer able to continue in my field
        of study. I still enjoy cooking but can't do it in a high-paced
        environment. At first, I was a little lost and even depressed because my
        life was taking a route I was not familiar with. It's natural for us, as
        humans, to try to discover who we are and why we're here. The following
        quote was spoken at my sister's graduation. It was exactly what I needed
        to hear at the time. Would you like to know what it was?
