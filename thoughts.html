        <h2 id="languages">My Language Learning Journey!</h2>
        <p>
          So far, I have learned three languages on my own: Korean, Japanese, Spanish, & French (High School) . I don't remember much of that one.
          I began this journey my freshman year of college. We were on break, and I wanted to do something effective with my time off from school. I was always someone who enjoyed learning, whether it be cultures, people, especially food, or anything out of the norm for me.
          <br>
          <h4>Korean</h4>
          The first language I chose was Korean because I wanted to learn something completely foreign to me. I believe education should be free, and being a college student [should I say more], I looked up any resources that could offer me that. I stumbled across websites like talktomeinKorean, Korean in plain English. Later, I became really immersed in the language and culture. I found shows that I loved: Running Man, The Return of Superman, and Eat Your Kimchi with Simon and Martina. The food and history drew me in, and I learned the best way to get to know someone is to talk to them, or, should I say, learn how to.
          <br>
          <h4>Japanese</h4>
          My next adventure landed me in Japan. Japanese was a bit more challenging than Korean because of the two or rather, three different alphabets: hiragana, katakana and kanji. Although it was a more challenging language, thanks to learning Korean, I was able to have a solid foundation in my approach. Japanese wasn’t as foreign to me as Korean was because I grew up watching anime and shows like - DBZ, Takeshi’s Castle, and Ninja Warrior. The resource I used mostly was NHK Japan.
          <br>
          <h4>Spanish</h4>
          My current adventure is Spanish; I found this one to be the easiest of the three but still challenging enough. Spanish has so many dialects that it is very hard to decide which one to choose. I personally prefer Caribbean Spanish—Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban. Most resources are centered around Spain’s Spanish, so that’s something you would have to pay attention to.
          <br>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          To summarize, I genuinely love learning languages because they teach about the people, their food, and cultures. So what language have you learned or would like to?
