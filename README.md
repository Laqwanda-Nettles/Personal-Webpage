# Personal-Webpage

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is my blog-inspired webpage that I built from scratch using the techniques I learned in class. It consists of 4 pages: landing, home, about, and thoughts. It features cards, images, and CSS animation.</p>
<h2>Wireframe</h2>
<p>This is my plan for the website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The wireframe was created on Canva.com.</p>
