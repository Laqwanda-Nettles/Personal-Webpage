        <h2 id="languages">My Language Learning Journey!</h2>
        <p>
          So far, I have learned three languages on my own: Korean, Japanese, Spanish, & French (High School) . I don't remember much of that one.
          I began this journey my freshman year of college. We were on break, and I wanted to do something effective with my time off from school. I was always someone who enjoyed learning, whether it be cultures, people, especially food, or anything out of the norm for me.
          <br>
          <h4>Korean</h4>
          The first language I chose was Korean because I wanted to learn something completely foreign to me. I believe education should be free, and being a college student [should I say more], I looked up any resources that could offer me that. I stumbled across websites like talktomeinKorean, Korean in plain English. Later, I became really immersed in the language and culture. I found shows that I loved: Running Man, The Return of Superman, and Eat Your Kimchi with Simon and Martina. The food and history drew me in, and I learned the best way to get to know someone is to talk to them, or, should I say, learn how to.
          <br>
          <h4>Japanese</h4>
          My next adventure landed me in Japan. Japanese was a bit more challenging than Korean because of the two or rather, three different alphabets: hiragana, katakana and kanji. Although it was a more challenging language, thanks to learning Korean, I was able to have a solid foundation in my approach. Japanese wasn’t as foreign to me as Korean was because I grew up watching anime and shows like - DBZ, Takeshi’s Castle, and Ninja Warrior. The resource I used mostly was NHK Japan.
          <br>
          <h4>Spanish</h4>
          My current adventure is Spanish; I found this one to be the easiest of the three but still challenging enough. Spanish has so many dialects that it is very hard to decide which one to choose. I personally prefer Caribbean Spanish—Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban. Most resources are centered around Spain’s Spanish, so that’s something you would have to pay attention to.
          <br>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          To summarize, I genuinely love learning languages because they teach about the people, their food, and cultures. So what language have you learned or would like to?

        <h2 id="freedom-soup">Soup Joumou: A Taste of Freedom!</h2>
        <p>
          Did you know that a soup could represent freedom? Well, since January 1, 1804, it has been true for many Haitian households. Originally reserved for slave owners, Haitians took ownership of the soup when they gained independence from France, turning it into a symbol of their newly acquired freedom and an expression of their dignity and resilience.
          <br>
          I love when fall begins, the temperatures drop, and it is time to dress in comfy clothing and warm up with your favorite bowl of soup. One of my favorite soups is called Soup Joumou, a Haitian pumpkin-based soup with beef, pasta, and many vegetables. It starts with Epis.
          <br>
          Epis is a seasoning base consisting of peppers, garlic, and herbs.
